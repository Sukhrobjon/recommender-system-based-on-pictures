# Recommender System Based on Image

## Description
* In this project I developed a method for identifiying the similar products visually. The taks was implementing an algorithm to find k most similar images to given(original) product and display it to user.


## How to use
* Please refer to this [file](recommend_similar_products.ipynb) as a source code.

## Data
* The main dataset is 2184 color images (150x150x3) with 7 brands and 10 products, and the file with labels style.csv. Photo files are in the .png format and the labels are integers and values. It is downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/style-color-images). 

## Built With

* [VGG16](https://keras.io/applications/#vgg16) - Transfer Learning
* [Cosine Similarity](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.html) - Similarity Metric
